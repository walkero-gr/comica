# comicami
**Comicami** is a light comic reader for the Amiga OS 4. It is able to read the .cbr and .cbz comic book formats. It is designed to be simple in usage and as fast as possible, without consuming too much memory from your system.

This is the free version of **Comicami**, which will not get new features, but only bug fixes. I am working on the advanced version which will be available to buy. That version will have a lot more features than the free one.

Features
--------
 - Resizeable page image, depending the window size
 - Sorted file list by filename
 - Buttons to jump to the next, previous, first, last pages
 - Shortcuts to jump to the next, previous, first, last pages
 - You can install it wherever you like
 - You can use it from CLI as from Workbench

Comicami is **transferred** to [bitbucket][1]. The code here is quite old.
